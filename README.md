# playlist-creator
generate .m3u playlist in a directory based on files

call like 'python3 create-playlist.py --dir /path/to/directory'

if --dir is omitted, it will use the current directory

playlist will be created as playlist.m3u in the root of the directory.

also supports .srt subtitles (English only but can be tweaked easily enough)
